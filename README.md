# 🤖 GoogleMoGago – Just Google It, Genius.

> Because even the AI can’t help your lazy friend type “What is Python?” into Google.

## 🧠 What is this?

**GoogleMoGago** is a gloriously sarcastic website that simulates the act of typing a Google search for someone — because apparently some people think asking you (or ChatGPT) to Google something *is* the search itself.

### Ideal for:

- Trolling your clueless coworker.
- Flaming that one Discord user who always asks before searching.
- Reminding your friend that even the smartest AI can’t fix dumb.

## 🤯 How it works

1. You type in a question your friend should’ve Googled.
2. We animate the typing like you’re their personal brain surgeon.
3. A celebration GIF plays — because YOU did the impossible: Googled.
4. Then it redirects to Google because, shocker, that’s where answers live.

## 💡 Why not just ask ChatGPT?

Because:
- It’s 2025 and people still don't use Google.
- AI models hallucinate. Google doesn’t think you're asking for a literal “how to raise a dead battery without magic.”
- Sometimes, roasting is the most effective education.

## 🔗 Share a Genius Moment

Every search creates a **shareable link** like: https://yourdomain.com?q=how%20to%20open%20a%20pdf


Send that to your "genius" friend and let them enjoy the animation (with some gentle digital shame).

## 🖼️ Features

- 🎉 Celebration GIF for added humiliation.
- 📋 Shareable, roastable links.
- 🌙 Dark mode, because sarcasm looks cooler in the dark.
- 🔥 Animated typing, because even laziness deserves theatrics.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone this repo.
2. Drop in your favorite celebration GIF as `celebration.gif`.
3. Serve the files with Live Server or host it on your sassy domain.
4. Laugh forever.

## 🧠 Credits

- Inspired by decades of people refusing to type 3 words into a search bar.
- Not affiliated with Google, but it sure depends on them.

## ✨ Final Thoughts

If AI can write poetry, compose music, and solve math — yet still can’t get your friend to use Google...  
Then **GoogleMoGago** is here to do what robots won’t: **shame them lovingly**.
